Nokia 5110 python library
=========================

For Raspberry Pi and virtual-GPIO.

This is a 3.3V device.
However as per  http://www.avdweb.nl/arduino/hardware-interfacing/nokia-5110-lcd.html 
the logic pins seem to be OK on 5V arduino if 10K resistors are used for each pin. YMMV.

As always, this code is built upon earlier work by others.
